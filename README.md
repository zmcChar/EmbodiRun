# RLinf Deploy

RLinf Deploy owns the last mile between an inference service and a robot or
simulator. It does not load checkpoints, import model frameworks, build prompts,
or execute neural networks.

RLinf Deploy -- HTTP --> RLinf Inference (VVLA)
        |
        v

```

## Repository boundary

| RLinf Deploy owns | RLinf Inference owns |
|---|---|
| Robot and simulator observations | Checkpoints and processors |
| HTTP client, retries, deadlines | Prompt and model forward |
| Session and step identifiers | Session memory and batching |
| Robot action validation | Model-output parsing |
| Go2 and FR3 control | DP, TP, CUDA Graph, compilation |
| SSH deployment and service routing | Canonical policy actions |

`third_party/vvla` pins the server implementation for integration and deployment
reproducibility. Runtime communication still crosses the versioned HTTP API; the
deploy package never imports VVLA Python modules.

## HTTP contract

The client expects these endpoints:

```text
GET    /healthz
GET    /v1/capabilities
POST   /v1/sessions
POST   /v1/sessions/{session_id}/steps
POST   /v1/sessions/{session_id}/reset
DELETE /v1/sessions/{session_id}
```

Step requests use `multipart/form-data`: one JSON metadata part followed by
binary image parts. Images are never base64 encoded. `request_id`, `step_id`,
and `session_revision` provide idempotency and ordering.

## FR3

Install the official Franky binding that matches the robot server version:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[fr3]'
```

The adapter follows the official Franky API:

- `Robot(host)` and `recover_from_errors()`
- bounded `JointMotion`
- bounded relative `CartesianMotion`
- optional `Gripper.move`
- state from `robot.state`

Physical execution is intentionally fail-closed. Joint and Cartesian step
limits are checked before Franky receives a command.

See `examples/fr3_http_step.py` for a single HTTP inference step followed by
execution of the returned action chunk.

## Go2

The existing Unitree Go2 camera/control agents and SSH deployer remain under:

```text
src/rlinf_deploy/robots/unitree/go2
src/rlinf_deploy/deployment/unitree/go2
```

The robot-resident processes remain isolated from model inference and expose
bounded HTTP control surfaces.

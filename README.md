# RLinf Deploy

RLinf Deploy owns the last mile between an inference service and a robot or
simulator. It does not load checkpoints, import model frameworks, build prompts,
or execute neural networks.

```text

        v
RLinf Deploy -- HTTP --> RLinf Inference (VVLA)
        |
        v
robot-specific safety and motion execution
```

## Repository boundary

| RLinf Deploy owns | RLinf Inference owns |
|---|---|
| Robot and simulator observations | Checkpoints and processors |
| HTTP client, retries, deadlines | Prompt and model forward |
| Session and step identifiers | Session memory and batching |
| Robot action validation | Model-output parsing |
| Go2 and FR3 control | DP, TP, CUDA Graph, compilation |
| SSH deployment and service routing | Canonical policy actions |

`third_party/vvla` pins the server implementation for integration and deployment
reproducibility. Runtime communication still crosses the versioned HTTP API; the
deploy package never imports VVLA Python modules.

## Environments

Use uv 0.12.x from the repository root. Each process installs only the capability
group it needs:

```bash
uv sync --frozen                                      # core + development tools
uv sync --frozen --no-dev --group host                # SSH orchestration
uv sync --python 3.12 --frozen --no-dev \
  --group robot-so101                                 # SO-101 control agent
uv sync --frozen --no-dev --group robot-fr3           # FR3 control agent
```

`robot-so101` requires Python 3.12 or newer. The repository does not set a global
Python version because the other environments continue to support Python 3.10.
Groups may be combined when one process genuinely needs multiple capabilities;
they are not mutually exclusive. Model inference dependencies remain owned and
locked by the Inference project, even when inference and robot services run on
the same physical node.

## HTTP contract

The client expects these endpoints:

```text
GET    /healthz
GET    /v1/capabilities
POST   /v1/sessions
POST   /v1/sessions/{session_id}/steps
POST   /v1/sessions/{session_id}/reset
DELETE /v1/sessions/{session_id}
```

Step requests use `multipart/form-data`: one JSON metadata part followed by
binary image parts. Images are never base64 encoded. `request_id`, `step_id`,
and `session_revision` provide idempotency and ordering.

## FR3

Install the official Franky binding that matches the robot server version:

```bash
uv sync --frozen --no-dev --group robot-fr3
```

The adapter follows the official Franky API:

- `Robot(host)` and `recover_from_errors()`
- bounded `JointMotion`
- bounded relative `CartesianMotion`
- optional `Gripper.move`
- state from `robot.state`

Physical execution is intentionally fail-closed. Joint and Cartesian step
limits are checked before Franky receives a command.

See `examples/fr3_http_step.py` for a single HTTP inference step followed by
execution of the returned action chunk.

Quick end-to-end flow:

```bash
# On Thor: run VVLA HTTP service for pi0.5
cd third_party/vvla
vvla-http-serve \
  --policy pi05 \
  --checkpoint <pi05-checkpoint> \
  --adapter-config ../../configs/pi05_http_serve.example.json \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8000 \
  --max-batch 1

# On deploy side: send one image + state and execute one FR3 command
cd ../..
python examples/fr3_http_step.py \
  --robot-host <fr3-ip> \
  --vvla-url http://<thor-ip>:8000 \
  --instruction "pick up the object" \
  --image /path/to/image.jpg
```

## Go2

The existing Unitree Go2 camera/control agents and SSH deployer remain under:

```text
src/rlinf_deploy/robots/unitree/go2
src/rlinf_deploy/bindings/unitree/go2/streamvln
```

The robot-resident processes remain isolated from model inference and expose
bounded HTTP control surfaces.
